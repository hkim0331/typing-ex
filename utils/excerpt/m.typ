D:A student may type 1 word per minute faster for each added
 :year of age: i.e., 13 to 14, to 15, to 16, to 17, to 18.

D:Often 25% of first-year students never do 25 words a minute.
 :Many second-year students can type about 45 words a minute.
 :More than 50% do not equal the practical rate of 50 words.

I:(5)
*:_M_R_L4
D:Why do we all thrill over sports?  Maybe it is the tireless
 :skill of the winner that we feel.  Ask the players.  They
 :may agree (Rice,* famous as a sports writer, said the cham-
 :pions all agreed) that skill is only part (50%) of it.

I:(6)
*:_M_R_L5
D:"When you step on the first tee," says the four-time gold
 :champion, Bobby Jones, "you know you can't afford to make
 :one careless slip."  A tired Bobby Jones (this was the way
 :Bobby told it to Rice) has stood on the 16th tee, leading
 :Smith by 18 strokes.

I:(7)
*:_M_R_L6
D:"Up to this point," says Bobby, "I had played 33 holes in 11
 :under par.  I believe it was the best golf I ever played in
 :my life.  But after easing up on the mental side I played
 :the last three holes in 5 over par."

I:(8)
*:_M_R_L7
D:In 1919 Babe Ruth shot into the records with 29 home runs.
 :Yet few know that the Babe worked five years in big games
 :before this start that led past Home Run #600.  You may
 :have cheered Jimmy Foxx and many another.  Yet you can still
 :picture the Babe after two strikes, smashing to the very
 :spot he had "called" a famous home run.

I:(9)
*:_M_R_L8
D:It is the effort against odds that thrills.  We feel these
 :drives that never let down.  We feel (this was the way Rice
 :put it) the champion forces himself into the winning frame of
 :mind.  Can the fast typist afford to do less?  A typist has
 :to face such days of "mental torture" too.  Some days he has
 :to force himself along.  He need not punish his machine.  He
 :must pull himself together (100%) to type his steady, smooth
 :way over all upsets.

I:(9A) Pointed Paragraph (m b)
*:_M_R_L9
S:     Men are bound to believe that business is bad in winter
 :months.  Maybe Mr. Smith remembers that most building became
 :better in September but both November and December seemed to
 :be much behind.  Monday morning my mail box became blocked
 :by urgent requests of many families that small-sized homes
 :be built.  Some jobs may begin to come now from the Chamber
 :of Commerce members.

S:Dear Dan,
 :

 :put cash in the bank and bear a bill or two.  The new deed
 :has done it.
 :
 :     The city has been busy but cold for two days.  Dear baby
 :has been to see her best aunt.  A band came by the door.
 :Baby let the bird cage drop down with a blow.  The bird died.
 :Boys put its dead body deep in a dark card case.  Baby also
 :has a ball and blue book to drop.  I put the boat away.  Its

S:Dear Bea,
 :
 :     I am glad you feel so for the farm in the East.  Even
 :as a girl of four or five I was ever so glad to find the
 :farm.  In my eyes it was all as good as gold.  Even my feet
 :felt good.  A girl can gain and grow fast on farm food and
 :the fine free air.  Why else did face and form grow full
 :and fair so fast?
 :
 :     On each foot of my farm I felt free from fear.  It
 :gave me my fill of fun.  I felt no fear of any fire in the
 :fall.  Now the fire is a fact and my farm is gone.  Give me
 :my full life, etc.  The game goes on.

S:Dear Hal,
 :
 :     Just a line to say I am lost if I cannot fly.  I
 :have to keep on here.  I knew it was but a hope last May.
 :It was just my last idea in June.  Yet I held my head high
 :and did not lose hope.
 :
 :     Why not fly up in the air a half hour or less and
 :look at my lake and our home on the hill?  I left it late
 :last July with one item on my list.  Bill gave me half an
 :hour of help.  Like the lady of the lake I met the king.
 :Bill was a kind king, too.
 :
 :     To lead off into the air and see all our lake so
 :long and lots of land so low, was to live a high hour.  I
 :kept my hand at my ear so as to help hear.  In the air my
 :hair was a loss.  It did not kill me.  I have to fly to know
 :life can be less hard.  I like to hold on and help Bill.  I
 :love to fly.

 :
 :     You must need the car.  Once the pass is open I can move
 :the car over to you.  Do you mind if I make it part of a nice
 :plan to meet Miss Page, too?  Mrs. Page was only a mile past
 :us.  Her son was my age and I made the mile at noon to play a
 :bit.  She paid us for milk.  She did not mean much to me, but
 :her son did.
 :
 :     Next we had more fun up the pass near the poor old No.

S:Dear Ross,
 :
 :     It is a real rain.  The road is so soft my car can but
 :roll, stop, and roll on.  Are you on the ship?  If I get as
 :far as the ship, can we sail in such a rain?  If we try to
 :sail, the ship is sure to rock or ride on one side.  If I get
 :sick, it is up to you to stay by and show us how to save the
 :ship.  Ann has some sort of song to sing in the rain.  She
 :said she sent it to you.
 :
 :     Did you read of our sale?  We set out a big sign.  Now
 :any sort of suit and any size seem to sell.  We are not rich
 :but we can soon step out or be sold out, if any such rate is
 :to rule.
 :
 :     Ann has not seen the ship as yet.  Rain or no rain, Ann
 :says to send her out.  All the rest of us say the same.  Can
 :you ring me in my room at the shop?
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(5) Pointed Paragraph (i u)
*:_M_R_L20
S:     The public is quite unfair about airing quibbles over
 :house furniture and fruit juices for the university crew.
 :The alumni inquiry into the failure of equipment figures in
 :the issue.  The alumni attitude is useful but continues to
 :put a premium on a victorious crew.  Only genius can guide
 :this outfit uphill and build a suitable crew that won't quit.

I:(6) Pointed Paragraph (d s -)
*:_M_R_L21
S:     Students should be assisted in studying seated at their
 :desks; cross-questioned as to their needs and desires; ad-
 :vised to use up-to-date leads based on studies of standards.
 :By-products of student days, well-bred friends, kindness,
 :self-help, with good grades and degrees, are listed as far-
 :sighted aids.  In Dad's old-fashioned address to his co-
 :workers, he said sadly that ideas are missed less than first-
 :class friends and good-natured wishers.

S:Dear Tris,
 :
 :     It is so very warm at this time of year, I told my wife
 :that you and I wish to go west for a week or two.  Did I
 :tell you what a wind we had?  I went to town to vote for the
 :one man whom I want.  I took a well-used tire.  When it went
 :down on a bad turn, in the woods, I had to walk.  Then the
 :wind more than set in, and I had to wait by a wall.  It got
 :our old tree.
 :
 :     I saw two men and set them to work on the car, till
 :they told me it was no use.  If I were to turn it in, is it
 :true that you can take your car?  I want a wide view and I
 :want to talk with you.  Thus I wait upon your word.  Wire
 :yes if you will take this trip.

 :     Could you apply to the court to allow my claim as agent

 :bills.  If asked, he can cover the costs by checks on a bank
 :that did not break.
 :
 :     Will you allow your child to come alone to see me?  He
 :can have every apple he can carry.  By the way, being clean
 :and above board, you must be above bad cases, but you began
 :to bring in off-color cases after April.
 :
 :     I agree you do not cross the law, but why let men win
 :in a black cause on any basis?  Why not build up your cases
 :from among men of our own class?  Close the awful cases you
 :now carry along to court, and begin again.

 :doctor is hurt by a first truck, another truck is struck,
 :and three contractors are thrown to the street.  The girl's
 :strong brother has been hurt.  Further, there are arrests
 :and the sort of extra details that enter into true stories.

S:Dear Fred,
 :
 :     I have dared to ask you for an extra favor on the first.
 :If you are not dated, I am to draft you to drive me by horse
 :or car up the grade to the field house at eight.  I guess you
 :have not heard fully about the great dance to be given by the
 :girls on the floor of the field house.
 :
 :     My hands have put fresh green goods on the walls.  Every
 :girl has a green dress, on its front a funny glass heart that
 :she gives as a favor.  The old folks can drive up early, eat
 :and drink and enjoy it all.  We will delay the dance till the
 :girls enter in a dozen files.  It would crush me to death if
 :an error were found in the plans.  Happy hours on earth are
 :never heavy.  Can you doubt that you are going?

S:Dear Madam,
 :
 :     I have your two later notes of March 1.  Maybe it is a
 :large order for you to leave for the north in the month of
 :March.
 :
 :     Our place is miles away, but the real issue is that mu-
 :sic means much to us.  A night of music, even one piece of
 :music, has often meant more to me than my local paper and all
 :the power I have known.  If I can plant a love of music in all
 :parts of this place so that all who hear you sing can learn to
 :love it, it will mean more to me than money.
 :
 :     I never laugh at money, but isn't it plain in these
 :lines that price ought to be the least of all the items?  The
 :point is that our plans for your party are more important.  If
 :you read our other offer in the light of our love for music,
 :we might not seem so far away.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

I:(5) Pointed Paragraph (u y)
*:_M_R_L31
S:     If truly quoted, you and Guy, mere youths, fly a con-
 :tinuous journey of thousands of miles yearly in your study
 :of numerous flying routes.  You say you were south in July
 :in the dry country conspicuous for yucca, but now you are
 :busy buying a quota of various useful items to supply your
 :outfit for the famous Yukon.  Yet I am suspicious when you
 :say this unusual survey is monotonous rather than glorious.
 :You should hurry surely to Vancouver for some delicious
 :yuletide fare.  It seems only yesterday that I was conscious
 :of being young and vigorous enough to fly my buoyant plane.
 :If you lucky boys are victorious over any unusually furious,
 :dangerous, or anxious double duty on this survey, write a
 :quotable account yourself for the Journal.

S:Dear Alice,
 :
 :     I shall start my river story since you have shown you like
 :my style.
 :
 :     The scene is a state in the South.  A sweet girl speaks of
 :the sound and sight of the river.  Seven men without shame raise
 :the stock sales and the boy tries to spend too much at the store.
 :In order to make a quiet and quick slide down the river, the men
 :seize the boat while the others, who are quite ready to serve the
 :girl, sleep.
 :
 :     It seems the girl has sense, for on a sheet of paper she
 :writes that her stock of gold is within reach from a round stone
 :under the small shade tree.  She does not quote the boy, but does
 :refer to the sorry end of his short study, and in her reply to his
 :folks she will state how the gold may still be spent in the right
 :way, which will stamp the story as real.

S:Dear Mrs. White,
 :
 :     I wish to thank you for the words you wrote three weeks ago,
 :and I trust you will write again on the wrong and waste of war.
 :
 :     As I watch the wheels of events today, I think you value a
 :thing it has taken me a third of my years to see.  In its total
 :trade the world is one whole, and each part in touch with the
 :other at most times.
 :
 :     The usual farm woman won't see a trade table or understand
 :its terms, for she is tired with her efforts to train and teach
 :her young.  She has tried to throw her value into her home, which
 :to her is worth so much.  War can not be put under until these
 :women see there is but one world, which truly is their world.
 :
 :     Where will you be while the thick wheat is harvested?  If
 :not across the water, would you visit us, using your voice to
 :teach us these things?
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:     Important dinner company in our small apartment was

 :The moment nine American gentlemen were announced, fun and

 :of much more income than mine, who was not solemn as imag-
 :ined, but funny and human, even if normal demand, planned
 :movements of modern machines to Canada, long term payments,
 :and columns of numbers meant much more to him than to me.

S:Dear Annabel,
 :
 :     My brother and his college friends in the factory decided to arrange an
 :evening exactly as in the old days.  After calling us, they arrived and we
 :carried out the idea.  We used an old college catalog and each girl had an
 :old college dress.
 :
 :     Further to advance the evening, my brother advised us of an old address
 :near the freight yard where certain college boys brought this or that article
 :and were allowed a few dollars.  As we went in, an old man came a step farther,
 :fell forward and against me.  Brother charged him.  Will you believe this care-
 :ful account I enclose?  Between brother and me lay this old man who did seem
 :dead.  I can't express my feeling.  His head was covered with marks of blows.
 :
 :     Already we were anxious to go.  Yet his safe was open, as if to furnish us

 :looked to see who of our company were in them, I read one balance after another

S:Dear Mrs. White,
 :
 :     I have been holding on, but this January I am getting out.
 :My wife herself may have told you of our opening.  However, I go
 :at ten o'clock this morning, and your husband is still out.  He is
 :to do my general work himself, and may not imagine there is any
 :measure of justice in that.  We married men are obliged to do as
 :ordered.
 :
 :     I am leaving a hundred matters.  He has my opinion on each.
 :Tell him the minutes of the last meeting of the members are on my
 :table.  Tell him I haven't an invoice, but have instead an October
 :bill, for our new machine parts.  He may mention this item to the
 :manager, as he has neither its history nor my letters of inquiry.
 :
 :     I find nothing else to include.  We shall miss you greatly,
 :and we shall be looking for you at our new home.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Patrick,
 :
 :     I realize that this letter I am sending may subject you to some trouble.
 :I am writing tonight without waiting to go through various reports on our
 :present program.  If I had thought that you would be willing to give me an
 :extra day, perhaps I would have come myself.
 :
 :     As soon as this letter has reached you, and you have finished reading the
 :several items about which I have written, I hope you can give extra working
 :time to my request for special records. These items will suggest a new plan as
 :I picture it.  I shall add them to this note.
 :
 :     It is my purpose to prepare a fast station-to-station service that should
 :be in running order soon.  I suppose it could be started next month.  Let me
 :ask, also, whether we could receipt each payment, as we receive it, on a
 :regular form similar to those in the package shipped you Tuesday.  I am pleased
 :with your showing.  You have been like a soldier on duty in any and all
 :weather.  Success is your teacher.
 :
 :With my best regards,

S:Dear Thomas,
 :
 :     First, I consider of definite interest anything from
 :the business of as good a customer as you.  As director of
 :our division, I am to continue handling building material.
 :My judgment on all the evidence, which I send herewith
 :enclosed in a second envelope, is one of complete approval.
 :Let me have a contract covering the earliest delivery date.
 :Are you advising me what increase in your discount is to be
 :expected?
 :
 :     Second, this forenoon I saw your son and he told me of
 :his marriage in February.  Although you had not entirely
 :finished the addition to your lake house by last December,
 :couldn't you exchange it, as it is, for my mountain home?
 :Your son said that his young wife wants to live on this
 :mountain to which all your children seem so attached.
 :
 :Sincerely yours,

S:Dear Nathan,
 :
 :     My last shipment has probably been received, for the purchase was made
 :Thursday.  Tomorrow is Saturday, a pleasant day, for I go on my vacation.
 :
 :     Do you remember an original idea you proposed last November relative
 :to planning for some shipping from my property?  My neighbor recently
 :called it a plan in a thousand, and we must get together so that I can
 :thank you properly.  This is a national as well as personal question,
 :and I am trusting that you will be thinking that it is possible for you to
 :help put it into practice.
 :
 :     If you can possibly separate yourself from teachers and your
 :teaching position sometime soon, plan to get a standard car and
 :whatever else is required for the trip.  The car would also be a
 :pleasure after you return to New York.  May I persuade you in re-
 :plying to state that you are planning to come promptly?  We will
 :make you one of the officers of the shipping business.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Son,
 :
 :     I am beginning this afternoon to give my immediate attention
 :to a Christmas that should be beautiful.  I have addressed, to be
 :forwarded and delivered in good condition, some new equipment
 :according to your wish.  I note, too, that your committee met.
 :What these gentlemen said is important and may be a sort of in-
 :surance that your plan does not fail.  I certainly would not want
 :to duplicate for you the kind of education given me.
 :
 :     Be different by following more than one new idea, including
 :some of your own.  If you can carefully take fair advantage of
 :every available condition, everybody should accept you cordially,
 :as answering to the character of a gentleman.  Mother is enclosing
 :a few lines.

S:Dear Gertrude,
 :
 :     This letter has no reference to shipments which you have
 :so kindly purchased from me in the past.  Rather, as you are
 :returning to this territory by September, our president has re-
 :quested me as secretary to ask that you make a statement before
 :our club the first Wednesday.
 :
 :     Let me say something of the questions we have been receiving
 :for the year.  Recently I read that the old principle today still
 :applies.  It is wonderful what our new knowledge has surprised us
 :into regarding as necessary for ourselves--sometimes things not
 :even mentioned yesterday.
 :
 :     Will you therefore represent this new deal and present the
 :situation to us in principle, sincerely, as you see it?  Other-
 :wise, if you cannot make this provision now, I shall be glad to
 :call upon you later.
 :
 :Yours sincerely,

S:Dear Alex,
 :
 :     We are especially interested in the settlement run by a
 :new department at the University.  We appreciate the importance
 :of its additional study to understand impossible conditions in
 :the poor parts of our city, and its use for adjustment of some
 :particular boy or girl.  Have you read our memorandum in this
 :connection?
 :
 :     Our city is absolutely too big.  With the automobile we can
 :distribute every person to his home along a line, our wide road,
 :run far out from the city.  The difference between country and
 :city grows less and less, in accordance with such use of the auto-
 :mobile.
 :
 :     Concerning our collection of any remittance from you, this
 :would serve to form a Conference which would develop everything
 :that can make city governments bring full and rich experience
 :to all.
 :
 :Sincerely yours,

S:Dear Sir,
 :
 :     I wish to acknowledge the recent interesting correspondence
 :from your office on the very considerable requirements of the new
 :law that have to do with any unfortunate advertising that might
 :appear in my papers.
 :
 :     Our association also has appreciated both your instructions
 :and the opportunity for prompt examination and understanding of
 :the new arrangement, particularly its application to all informa-
 :tion given the public about merchandise for sale.  This has been
 :a real convenience in our consideration of the entire proposition.
 :
 :     I want to assure you that our co-operation under the new law
 :will be satisfactory in every way.

I:(6) Pointed Paragraph (l r z)
*:_M_R_L61
S:     The JOURNAL learned that the relatives on their arrival in
 :April had already referred the trouble to lawyers.  Their early re-
 :turn surprises me.  As to the children themselves, the older girls
 :are personally agreeable, slender, and certainly full of zest.  They
 :travel yearly and already are familiar with the world.  Their father
 :was a quizzical old man who fairly idolized them.  His will leaves
 :them very nearly a half-million dollars.  Only the earlier, first
 :will is very irregular.  I've already quizzed them about the real
 :hazards of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size.  From their
 :replies I've realized slowly that the girls are all right.  It
 :really amazes me that even persons like ourselves promptly seize
 :upon some hostile relative's version of an earlier will, which
 :should be recognized easily as false.
